# 🎓 Blockchain Certificate Verifier

A decentralized web application (DApp) built using **Ethereum, Solidity, and Web3.js** for secure and tamper-proof certificate issuance and verification.  
This project ensures authenticity and transparency by storing certificate data on the blockchain.

## Features

- 🧾 **Issue Certificates** — Admin can issue certificates directly to the blockchain.  
- 🔍 **Verify Certificates** — Anyone can verify certificate authenticity using the Certificate ID.  
- ⚠️ **Revoke Certificates** — Admin can revoke invalid or fraudulent certificates.  
- 💡 **MetaMask Integration** — Connect wallet and interact directly with the deployed smart contract.
